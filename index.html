						<h4 align="center">Battletested: Gabe Marks' story</h4>
                        <p align="center">Evergreen reporter</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stands with his back against the wall, casually leaning against it while running his fingers through his jet black hair, attempting to tame it before the camera begins to roll. “Midterms, man,” he laughs as his hair refuses to relinquish its unruly curls.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>He pulls the collar on his polo shirt, emblazoned with the Cougar logo, so it is straight.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>He takes a breath and begins to speak. His posture and unhurried tone allude to a casual Gabe Marks, but do not be deceived.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>His eyes are fervent; they appear to spark despite their deep brown color, the only clue to the intensity that surfaces most often on the field – and when he gets the chance to talk about others.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>“Who inspires me? Everybody. People that do cool things. Winners inspire me. People that don’t give up. Everybody has got their own thing, everyone is an inspiration once you get to know them,” he said, leaning forward.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>It seemed simple to the redshirt junior wide receiver, the answer came as easily to him as the word Superman might to a five-year-old. </p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>It is people and the game that fascinate him. He is magnanimous in his treatment of others, a trait that seems uncommon among athletes.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Each Saturday, it’s the masses filling stadiums to the brim that have a front row seat to the singular focus and passion that results when a person gives every fiber of their being over to a pursuit.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>When it comes to Marks, there is no such thing as good enough, good or anything less than the best.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>“I always want to be the best receiver in the country,” Marks said.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Unlike many athletes, it is not arrogance and selfish lust for the spotlight that fuels his desire.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Marks does not want to be the best for the attention – he has experienced the good, the bad and the ugly that comes with being an elite athlete in that respect; he genuinely wants to better himself, for himself.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Marks does not seek the recognition that comes with it, although he doesn’t mind it.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>“I like making plays on TV, that’s kind of my thing. And also helping the team,” Marks said. “I feel like if I make plays then I’m helping the team.”</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>He does not apologize for his confidence; but, then again, he has no reason to. </p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>This season he has been a pillar of the offense.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Against Arizona, he caught four touchdown passes, setting a school record.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>He currently leads the Pac-12 in receptions and touchdown receptions and is second in receiving yards.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>In the two games prior he tore defenses apart, catching two touchdowns each game. </p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>He was nominated to the Biletnikoff Award Watch List prior to the Oregon State game.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>As the nation takes notice of the inhuman statistics and talent, Marks puts his head down and continues to work.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>He always seems to have a chip on his shoulder, a chip formed by circumstance and fed by his relentless drive and burning ardor to prove to himself that he is on his way.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>						
						<p>“You never actually know if you actually belong at this level until you get in there and it happens,” Marks said. “Then you know, ‘I can do this.’ That is important.”</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>In the rare instance that he finds himself outmatched – be it by an injury or an opponent – his tenacity and grit and utter refusal to quit prohibits any force from stopping him on the field.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>						
						<p>“Say someone gave you the chance to go up against an Olympian and you’re only in high school, you might get a little nervous.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>You might get a little intimidated, but that’s not in his DNA,” said Ron Allen, Marks’ trainer since eighth grade.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>The equivalent of an Olympic opponent did not always come from the field.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>When Marks was nine years old, his father was murdered in his hometown of Venice, California.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Marks had only played football for a season before one of his biggest fans was no longer there.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>						
						<p>“He really didn’t speak about it,” Marks’ mother Jordanna Gersh said. “He took all his anger, frustration and disappointment about his father being gone out on the field.”</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>When football season arrived the next year, the game became an outlet and a healer.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Each exhausting practice and game, he worked to find a release as much as he worked to be one of the best.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>The field was a place of solace, but it was not long before football became much more than therapy.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Although football became more of a fervent passion than therapy with time, he continued to spring out of the tunnel each Saturday wearing the number nine, a reminder of how old – or more aptly how young – he was when his life was altered.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>By the eighth grade, football was consuming every waking moment Marks was not spending in school.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>He would get up early every morning for football workouts and practices while his friends that were living with he and his mother were still asleep.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>						
						<p>Marks would leave the two bedroom apartment that he, his mother and four of his friends shared and drive to B2G Sports, where he would work out with high schoolers bound for collegiate programs across the country.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Amongst those older athletes, it was again the absence of any fear that set him apart.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>“It’s his willingness to compete on every level,” Allen said. “That’s rare.”</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>He has always been willing: willing to work harder than anyone to reach the top; willing to sacrifice his childhood; willing to put it all on the line for 60 minutes each week.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>The one component of the player he is now that was completely altered was his willingness to put his body on the line for a first down conversion, another ten yards, a touchdown.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>By his own admission, Marks did not like the contact aspect of football initially. </p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>He played basketball as a boy rather than Pop Warner football. Marks is not a giant by any means, even now. </p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>He stands 6-feet tall and weighs 190 pounds, but before he had matured, keeping weight on his small frame was difficult.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>“He was always considered smaller then, or very frail, not as heavy. He always had a hard time keeping on weight. So I think that played an impact on him not wanting to get hurt,” Gersh said. “Even at Venice High, he did not want to get hit. He would do everything in his power to get the touchdown or complete the play without getting hit.”</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>It was not until he reached Washington State that he began to welcome contact on the field. During the Oregon State game, Marks thrice left the field limping or woozy, and returned each time.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>On a particularly brutal hit, Marks jumped to meet a high pass and was sandwiched between a linebacker and a defensive back. </p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>In typical Gabe Marks fashion, he held onto the ball and was back on the field for the next drive.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Since signing his letter of intent with WSU, Marks abandoned all remnants of caution on the field. </p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>During his freshman year, he played in all 12 games. </p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>His sophomore year he played in all 13 games, starting nine, and tied for a team-leading seven touchdown grabs.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Then it all came to a screeching halt.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Marks had been struggling with injuries and illness during the off-season, and the winter before, Marks was arrested for his part in a bar fight which resulted in his citation on four misdemeanor charges.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>“People think I was an out of control problem kid. I wasn’t,” Marks said. “I made a couple of mistakes.”</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Despite the initial disappointment that followed the decision to redshirt Marks, that year off proved to be much needed. In essence, Marks hadn’t known a year that didn’t completely revolve around football since he was in fifth grade.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>“He has worked so hard to get to where he is. I’ve never seen a kid work that hard,” Marks’ uncle Greg Chambers said.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>While other kids were playing pick-up games of basketball, going to the movies and growing up gradually, Marks was thrust into the fray of being wholly at the mercy of a sport. Every aspect of life was related to football or school until it swallowed Marks. Football became who he was.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>“He knows who he is, and I think he’s comfortable with himself,” Gersh said. “Before, I think he thought of himself as a football player named Gabe Marks. I used to tell him, ‘You are Gabe Marks, who just happens to play football.’”</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>During that year, Marks had many conversations with his grandpa and his uncle, talking through the disappointment and frustration he felt as he was pulled away from the very thing that had dictated his life for the past 10 years.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>The sport he loved had exacted a harsh and unavoidable cruelty on him. Having his identity inextricably tied to football helped him to cope with his father’s death and brought him to WSU with a fully-funded education, but it cost him dearly.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>“It’s hard. It’s hard when your identity all your life is just that you are this amazing football player that everybody is waiting to see every week,” Gersh said. “I think for athletes what happens is they get into this, ‘I’m going to be forgotten about’ mindset… He was worried with finding his identity outside of football. It was a struggle.”</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Having time to reflect and relieve some of the pressure changed him as much off the field as it did on it. He matured. He let go. </p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>He found himself more dedicated while maintaining a sense of self away from the game he so loves.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>“He smiles a lot more [now],” Chambers said. “There is a sense of lightheartedness that he has now that he didn’t have before.”</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Football never ceased to be a colossal part of Marks’ life during that year; it just momentarily stutter-stepped. He contributed to Thursday Night Football and sustained a rigorous work-out routine, his eyes already on the next season.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Now nearly three-quarters of the way through his first season back, he hasn’t skipped a beat. And although that may surprise some, for Marks there is no such thing as regression.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>But now, he has a redefined relationship with the game. His time on the field isn’t overshadowed by the fear of being lost among the masses should something happen. He knows who he is, what he is capable of.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>“The rest of the world, they know him as number nine, the guy that catches a lot of touchdowns,” Chambers said. “But outside of the uniform, you take the helmet off, he’s an extremely smart kid, extremely perceptive of the world. He is curious, intellectually curious.”</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>As a sociology major minoring in philosophy, Marks is doing what he always has done: chasing what he loves. </p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>His desire to figure out why the world is the way it is, why people are the way they are, does not make him different from many others. </p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>It is the time he devotes to studying something that truly interests him while also devoting ungodly amounts of work to football.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>For that, he stands alone.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>He is as much a football player as he is a scholar. He is as much a teammate as he is a friend. </p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>He is unapologetically confident and he is genuine, sensitive and caring. </p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>He picks the highest possible goal and sets his mind to it, but is not disillusioned by the scale of it.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>In the hallway outside the conference room, he smiles and offers his reasoning behind his desire to be the best, “If I strive for that, it could work out, it might not, but if you set the bar high enough and you fall short, you’ll still fall pretty high.”</p>

						<h4 align="center">Coming Home</h4>
                        <p align="center">Braden Johnson | Evergreen reporter</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Monday's press conference leading up to Washington State's homecoming football game against Oregon State, two areas of improvement were highlighted that would lead the Cougs to victory: playing a four-quarter game in all phases and not playing down to the level of their competition.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Specifically, this starts with coming out focused against OSU (2-3, 0-2Pac-12), and avoiding a letdown in front of what is expected to be a nearly sold-out Martin Stadium.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>The two teams may essentially had opposite performances on the road last weekend - WSU stunned the UO in double overtime, 45-38, in Eugene, and OSU got whooped, 44-7, by Arizona - but this is not a game the Cougars (3-2, 1-1) can enter in cruise control.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>"We're not in a position to take anyone lightly," redshirt junior wide receiver Gabe Marks said at the press conference. "Every week it has been coming down to the wire."</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>WSU may be an eight-point betting favorite as of Thursday, and while the Beavers rank dead last in scoring offense (19.8 ppg), passing offense (139.4 ypg) and total offense (320.4 ypg) in the conference, Marks said it best: "They're still a Pac-12 team."</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>The Beavers are in rebuilding mode under first-year Head Coach Gary Anderson.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Leach praised Anderson - who coached the Wisconsin Badgers the last two years - and his history of success.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>"They're a tough, hard-nosed team," Leach said of the Beaver defense. "They're tall by secondary standards and I know Gary brought some guys in from Utah. They have a funny way of getting their corners drafted in the NFL."</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>OSU ranks first in the Pac-12 in passing defense (177.6 ypg) and even as they have worn down in the second-half of its losses to Michigan, Stanford and Arizona, all three defensive meltdowns came via the running game.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Redshirt sophomore linebacker Peyton Pelluer maintained that he and the other 10 defensive players on the field just have to continue to play with the mindset first-year Defensive Coordinator Alex Grinch has instilled - playing with the intent to create turnovers.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>"It's pretty straightforward," Pelluer said of watching OSU game film. "They're nothing too fancy. We just have to play our game."</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>The Beavers’ kryptonite - and where WSU will have the capability to put away the game early - is a one-dimensional offensive attack. </p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>True freshman quarterback Seth Collins has thrown for 637 yards through four games and leads the Beavers in rushing yards (362) while accounting for nine touchdowns, and has proven to be the one player capable of leading the OSU offense down the field.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Collins has flashed some long-term potential in Anderson's system, but has also shown there is a learning curve with the collegiate level. </p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>With an inexperienced offensive line, he has displayed tendencies to make his reads prior to the snap, and if leading receivers junior Victor Bolden and sophomore Jordan Villamin are not open, will immediately tuck the ball and try to run for extra yardage.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>It's an attack that sometimes can be quite effective, but is limited in variety and prone to turnovers.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>It will be imperative for Pelluer and leading tacklers senior linebacker Jeremiah Allison and senior safety Taylor Taliulu to cover the middle of the field, stay home and bait Collins into turning the ball over.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Collins' status is questionable for the game, however, after being knocked out of the contest last week, getting plastered on several sacks.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>WSU had success running the ball against the Ducks last week - a better team at defending the run than the Beavers - and if redshirt sophomore quarterback Luke Falk throws the ball down the field with success like he did the last two weeks, the Cougars can seize control of this game early.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>The Cougar offense is scoring 11.8 points per game more than OSU this season.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>In the Beavers’ losses, all three teams had little trouble moving the ball and forcing the young team to succumb in the third quarter each time. 
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Fast and frequent scoring and ball control will keep the game at a pace the OSU offense cannot keep up with.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Marks talked about how most WSU players come from winning programs in high school and have become fed up with consistent losing and underwhelming performances at home, as evident in their struggles to put away a winless Wyoming Cowboys team in a 31-14 win, and in the Week 1 loss to Portland State where the team looked like a street-side tire fire.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>"It's time for us to start winning games," Marks said.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>If WSU wants to win consecutive games for the first time since 2013 and inch closer to a bowl bid, it will require a focused mentality when playing in front of a home crowd.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>OSU has had its struggles, but is in no way a team to be overlooked. The Cougars just have to dodge the Beaver trap and avoid a letdown.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>The game will kick off at 1 p.m. Saturday in Martin Stadium. For those unable to attend, the game will be broadcast on the Pac-12 Networks.</p>

                        <p align="center">Fletcher Bailey | Evergreen football reporter</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Late in the fourth quarter of the Cougars’ home opener, it was fourth and one against a defense that had relentlessly attacked the football throughout the game, and there he was: quarterback Luke Falk, prized pilot of WSU’s air-raid offense, flying airborne and head-on into the shoulder of a stalking, locked-in linebacker.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>“You gotta show your team you’re willing to do what it takes to win,” Falk said.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Now, Luke Falk stands erect and drinks from his league-approved cup with one hand in his pocket and an unrelenting eye contact that waits eagerly and attentively for a reason to offer his insight.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>“You don’t want someone else making the play, you want to be the guy,” Falk said. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>“That’s why you play the game, that’s why you do everything you do: for that last minute of the game.”</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>His presence in conversation is akin to the way a learned doctor speaks to his patient before a routine checkup: prepared, relaxed and quick-witted. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>There’s no questioning with this guy; he’s got a handle on the situation.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>“We call him Cool Hand Luke. He didn’t always have it, though,” his sister Natalee Falk said. “I remember growing up, Dad yelling, ‘Luke, stop looking for butterflies in the backfield. Get your head in the game.’”</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>He’s since evolved into that cool-handed quarterback, garnering raucous praise from fans and pundits alike. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>Following game two of Falk’s current season, the NCAA awarded him Pac-12 player of the week for his late-game heroics and gaudy game numbers.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Falk also, again, found himself at the receiving end of a head-on collision in a desperate 13 yard run for what was a do-or-die drive against Rutgers that brought the Cougars to the eight-yard line and set up the game winning touchdown.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Luke Falk doesn’t slide.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>“Ugh, when he runs the ball I cringe,” Natalee said. “But it shows he’s in it to win it, and he always has been, even throughout the ups and downs.”</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Natalee spoke in reference to Falk’s gravely-timed family move to California from Utah before the start of his junior season, a season known as primetime for college recruitment.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Falk faced limited options in Cornell and Idaho before Mike Leach invited him to play alongside freshman quarterback Tyler Bruggman, WSU’s first four-star quarterback recruit since the early 2000’s.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>“It was hard to pass up the Ivy League opportunity,” Falk’s mother Analee said in an interview with Cougfan.com “But Luke told me, ‘Mom, I need to do this.’”</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The decision would prove fruitful for the budding quarterback, and it wasn’t the first time Falk had made an executive decision, as controversial as it may have been.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Falk’s sister said he had always been a multi-sport player growing up. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>He played basketball in high school during the football off-season and played a range of sports through junior high. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>She said there was one particular day, though, when everyone in the family knew he had made a serious life choice.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>“It was toward the beginning of football season his freshman year in high school,” Natalee said.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>“He walked up to Mom and said ‘Mom, I’m going to play football. That’s what I’m going to do.’ </p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>He told her he was born to play football.”</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Making dreams a reality seems to run in the Falk family, which also features former Utah State defensive end Eric Falk, Luke’s father, and Analee’s brother Jeff Anderson, former guard for Utah State Basketball.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Falk spent most of his life with his family in Logan, Utah, a small town in the country that revolves around its school sport teams.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Falk knew he was entering familiar territory coming to Pullman, Washington and should add to calm, cool-handedness according to his sister.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>“He loves Pullman. He’s so grateful for his opportunity to be there and it’s just so similar to where he grew up,” Natalee said.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>She said Luke had never wavered on his commitment to football, and idolized Tom Brady for his poise and play-style since he was a child.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>“You see it in his press conferences he’s together, and poised and witty,” Natalee said.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Standing at the podium addressing his Week 2 win versus Rutgers University, Falk said he made it a point to lighten up the mood with Coach Leach heading into what would be their game-winning drive.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>“I said (Patriots safety) Devin McCourty is here and he’ll put in a good word to Tom Brady for me,” Falk said. “So, uh, let’s go score this drive here.”</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Cool Hand Luke was chill as ever heading into that game-deciding drive, the same drive that would find Falk rushing the football directly into the fixed sights of an enabled defender.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Falk proved by rushing the second week in a row into contact, especially after going down hard and leaving the game in week one, that he simply is not fazed. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>He’s focused. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>He’ll do what it takes to win.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>“There’s a side to him that’s super competitive, like aggressively competitive. Even in a game of cards he’s not going down without a fight,” Natalee said. “Even to this day, though, he’ll tell you I’m the only one that could beat him in Mario Kart.”</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Falk likely hasn’t let that go, either. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>He’s a noted hard-worker. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>The type anyone would look for in a leader of a team, coming in first, leaving last and setting an example for his teammates.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>“He works harder than they do,” Leach said. “Everybody knows he works harder than they do.”</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>That’s not an affront to the rest of the team as much as it is a credit to Falk’s incredible work ethic. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>He loves the game and gives it his all; almost as much as his dog, Cayenne.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>“You know, we’re really glad he got a girlfriend,” Natalee said. “For a minute there we were worried about him the way he loves that dog. But he’s alright now. We’re good.”</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Falk threw for almost twice as many yards in his second-week performance as he did in week one. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>He looks forward to leading his team to even more spectacular wins this season.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>“Our best is yet to come,” Falk said. “Our team’s a great team and we have a lot to show for it pretty soon.”</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>When the game’s almost inevitably on the line once again, Falk will make good on his great team’s efforts and get those precious yards where they need them, even if it means taking a shot or two.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>What the Cougs have here has not been a failure to communicate, but a man and his will to win over his opponent even with the odds stacked against him.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Upcoming teams would fare best by heeding the arm of Cool Hand Luke. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>If his red-hot start is any sign of what’s to come, then this gunslinger’s only warming up.</p>

						<p align="center"> Fletcher Bailey | Evergreen Football Reporter </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
						
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s a producer, a recording artist, a videographer, and the starting strong safety for Washington State University.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p> Let Taylor Taliulu tell it though, and he’s a standing representation of his family; both Cougar and blood alike.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>“You ask him about pretty much anything and he’ll talk for hours,” said his father Tausili Taliulu. “But, you ask him about himself and he’ll give you a hard time.”​</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>​Taliulu earned all-state honors and was a top-ten Hawaii prospect leaving high school. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>Still, he’ll tell you his greatest accomplishment is neither honor nor accolade.​​</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>​“I could have buckled a long time ago and said this is too hard,” Taliulu said. “So every day when I wake up and lift, then go to class, then go to meetings, and then finish my homework, I feel blessed. It’s an accomplishment that I’m proud of on a daily basis.”​</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Taliulu is humble, cordial, and sincerely spoken. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>His relaxed vibe and dispositional smile allow very little evidence of the beast that lies within.​</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Standing at six feet and 205 pounds, he employs the role of the last line of defense against approaching offenses.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p> He knows his team depends on him in a big way, but he’s no stranger to high expectations.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>“So many people have invested time into me,” Taliulu said. “I went back home and those last couple trips back I’ve seen how little kids look up to me. When I step on that field now, I do it for the Cougar fans, my family, and everyone who looks up me to back home.”​</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>He’s driven by the opportunity to make an impact on the lives of others. Be it through entertainment on multiple platforms, or simply a warm greeting, his aim is at all times to please.​</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>“I just want to make people proud,” he said. “I just go out there and ball and have a good time… and make sure the fans have a good time.”​</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>WSU’s coaches impress upon players a “know your why” philosophy.​</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>It’s only in understanding Taliulu’s ‘why’ that one could make sense of his effortless transformation from warm, welcoming Taylor to imposing, intimidating Taliulu every Saturday.​</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>​If he does ever acknowledge any motivation fueled by self-interest, it’s his commitment to being successful in a career outside of college.​</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>​Uniquely, Taliulu could take a variety of career paths, all of which he’s explored and curated while playing football successfully and at a high level.​</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>He purchased a camera and produced a highly-regarded four-part series of behind-the-scenes looks at training camp with the Cougar football team while actively participating in camp workouts this summer.​</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>​The series, aptly titled The Grind, chronicles last year’s season highlights in episode one, followed by episodes spotlighting gym workouts, the infamous “Leach Beach” sand pits, and finally a refreshing look at some team brotherhood at Snake River.​</p>
                        ​<p>Taliulu said although he possesses talents in film making, he is especially passionate about music. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>With a mixtape dropping later this month titled East Side Story themed around life and experiences at WSU. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>The EP is written and produced mostly by him, save three or four songs with special coproduction.​</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>​Taliulu said he seeks to pursue music more aggressively following the football season. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>That, along with his clothing line currently in development, are projects he hopes to monetize soon.​</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>​But, even then, that motivation boils down to a commitment to his loved ones.​</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>​Taliulu said he wants to be financially sound to eventually provide for his family back home. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>His father acknowledged the caveat to growing up in paradise.​</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>​“Everything is so expensive here,” Tausili said. “Everyone has to work two or three jobs to get by, so you have to rely on your family a lot.”​</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>​It’s visible on Taliulu’s face when he speaks about his will to help support the people he loves so dearly. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>A nod of the head and sudden sternness dispel smiles and inquisitiveness when the conversation arises.​</p>
                        ​<p>Taylor Taliulu wears his heart on his sleeve. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>Family and friends know he inherently harbors a deep regard for them. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>As such, his opponents know that he harbors a similar level of disdain for them.​</p>
                        ​<p>“Family is everything. You do whatever it takes to take care of your family,” he said. “Anyone that’s coming in from the outside to mess with that, it’s my job to make sure that doesn’t happen.”​</p>
                        ​<p>Ohana means family, and Taliulu’s ohana away from home are his Cougar football teammates. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>Herein, the beauty of his game is the passion with which he plays it.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p> No one messes with Taliulu’s ohana, and he enforces that law with a heart and ferocity that is solely his own.​</p>
                        ​<p>He’s a self-proclaimed ‘chill and easy-going guy.' </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>And, in a perfect world, he’d embrace the competitive nature of the game while simultaneously boosting the morale of everyone around him. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>He’d take on an Andrew Luck-esque congratulatory rapport with the defense, acknowledging sound mechanics and applauding impressive plays by the opposition.​</p>
                        ​<p>Except, this isn’t a perfect world, and Taliulu doesn’t take kindly to folks who threaten his family. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>The Cougar end zone is the house of his ohana and he dares opposing ball-carriers to try to break that plane.​</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>​“He’s a different person when he enters the game,” said Matt Tsukazaki, Taliulu’s AAU Basketball Coach. “It’s a switch. You see him out there on the field and he’s just so focused.”​</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>​The strong safety’s road from AAU basketball to Division-1 college football wasn’t the smoothest of journeys, though.​</p>
                        ​<p>“It’s been a rocky road and there have been some bumps along the way, but he’s a fighter,” Tausili said. “He’s a fighter. He’s gonna fight for Cougar fans, for his teammates, and for his family.”​</p>
                        ​<p>Taliulu started at safety in the first two games of his freshman season, only to find himself playing on special teams through the remainder of the schedule finishing with 22 tackles total.​</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>​Still, he was not discouraged. He competed and earned ten starts during both his sophomore and junior campaigns, tallying 54 and 66 tackles respectively, including a career-gem 12 tackle game against California last season.​</p>
                        ​<p>This time around, he hopes to capitalize on three varsity-letter seasons. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>Taliulu seeks to improve his play and use his influence as a veteran to elevate the play of the entire defensive unit.​</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>​Tsukazaki said he remembers how Taliulu’s influence affected his AAU team growing up. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>He said Taliulu exhibited a very lax and playful nature with his friends and team mates outside of games and practices.​</p>
                        ​<p>Taliulu said he still possesses that fun-loving, optimistic outlook on life and accredits it to his hometown.​</p>
                        ​<p>“It’s just a mindset. Aloha spirit,” he said. “Yeah, that’s what they call it in Hawaii, you just have love for everyone.”​</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>​Tsukazaki said Taliulu’s easy spirit had been a blessing many times during his tenure coaching the young athlete.​</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>​“No matter how long it’s been since I’ve seen him, I can always recall his smile,” Tsukazaki said. “That smile made a lot of heavy situations lighter. Really, it kept a few situations from turning for the worst.”</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>​Here, Taliulu presents an interesting conundrum for fans to ponder: He’s found a way to play a violent, aggressive position at a high level, but utterly out of a place of love; a love for his teammates, and for the game, and for everyone who’s ever had an impact on his life.​</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>​In a sense, every time he leaps into the air for a pass deflection or squares his shoulders for a stadium-rocking hit, it’s never without a purpose broader than that of simply stopping the opposing offense.​</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>​Tsukazaki said Taliulu may be easier to sum up than he seems.​</p>
                        ​<p>“A majority of what makes Taylor who he is - and I’m going to get emotional here - is his love for his family and his desire to represent them well,” he said. “That drive has made him the man he is today, and the man *sniff* who’s life I’m extremely proud to have been a part of.”​</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>​Taliulu mentioned his address to teammates entering this first game week of the season.​</p>
                        ​<p>“Like I said in our last team meeting,” he said. “No matter on or off the field, make an impact on people.”​</p>
                        ​<p>Taliulu looks to improve on last year’s successes. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>And, if we’ve learned anything about him, he’s certain to make a crushing impact on anyone who steps between him and the house of his ohana.​</p>

						<p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To many Washington State students, President Elson S. Floyd was a beacon of positivity and encouragement. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>Floyd was often the first to greet new students with a warm hello.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>But for Washington State athletics, he was a hero. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>The late president managed to do something extraordinary for the program during the eight short years he was in office. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>Although the athletics program as a whole has struggled to find success, Floyd made fans believe that greatness was right around the corner. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>His enduring faith in Director of Athletics Bill Moos and the actions Moos has taken to improve the program have comforted fans and encouraged them to keep cheering.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>His commitment to improving athletic facilities in such a short time was unparalleled across the nation.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>Because of all this and more, all teams have come together in honoring Floyd with patches or stickers for their uniforms featuring the late president’s initials: ESF.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p> Announced last week, Moos shared some kind words explaining why the department decided to honor Floyd this way.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>“This is an opportunity for Cougar athletics to show appreciation for our dear late president and hopefully, in a respectful way, pay tribute to the many wonderful things he did for Washington State University and how endeared he has been and always will be by Cougars everywhere,” he said.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>Cougar teams have had their share of disappointing seasons recently. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>Even when teams find some success their seasons tend to end disastrously, like in the New Mexico bowl two years ago.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>But Floyd still managed to give us hope, even in his last months as WSU President.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>President Floyd helped usher in a new era of Washington State athletics. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>One where no task is too great, and no coach is too high-profile to come to the Palouse. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>Who would have thought that Mike Leach, godfather of modern college offenses, would choose to coach in Pullman?</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Floyd’s confidence in the process and commitment to excellence played a big part in that.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>In this new era, athletes are no longer discouraged from coming to Pullman. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>Many teams know they are right around the corner from finding success, and it was Floyd’s encouragement and optimism that helped drive that belief. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>Floyd helped to show all people how great Pullman and WSU is, and that attitude has helped the program recruit talented athletes from around the nation and even the world.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>So this year when you look at WSU uniforms and see those three letters, remember what they represent.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>Remember his warm smile, his comforting voice, and his unwavering confidence in all people, especially in Cougars. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>						
                        <p>And when you are cheering on your favorite WSU athletics teams this year, remember the man that helped bring prominence.</p>
